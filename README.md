# georgian-verb-conjugations-dataset
A list of Georgian verbs with their major conjugations (source, Campbell).

The dataset contains 319 Georgian verbs with conjugations for the major screeves (Present, Aorist, sometimes Future), yielding 2,386 conjugated verb forms. Conjugations for the minor screeve (eg conditional, imperfect) can be derived more or less systematically from these. Campbell's Georgian Verbs Comprehensive was used to check these conjugations.
